Description
-----------

This project is aimed at creating a robot
which will be able to follow a path specified
by the user on an arena.

The path will be drawn on a GLUT canvas.
Path is basically a series of points interpolated with circular arcs.
Both drag and click features are provided to specify the points of the path.

#### Example of a path which can be drawn

<img alt="Sample path drawn on GLUT canvas" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/udiboy1209/Autonomous-Path-Follower/master/sample_path.png" width="300" height="auto" align="centre"/>

As you can see, the path formed is continuos and differentiable.
We use a specific algorithm for this interpolation.

    git clone http://www.github.com/udiboy1209/Autonomous-Path-Follower

Installing GLUT
---------------

Run this command

    sudo apt-get install freeglut3 freeglut3-dev

Then cd to the folder named `Autonomous-PathFollower/glut` and run

    make
    make clean
